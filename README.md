# How to Github
For those who have not used github before please follow these guidlines when working on this project.
  1. Never commit to master.
  2. Always make a branch when working on a part of the project.
  3. Merge that branch to develop.
Also as a good practice you want to follow when working on a project is to have someone approve your PR (pull request) for someone who has not committed code to that PR. This keeps the project looking clean and make sure not broken code is commited.

For this project please let someone know if you have a current branch working. Always make sure that you are working on the current version of develop.
